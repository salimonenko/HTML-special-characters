# HTML-special-characters
Table of special HTML characters. I used material already collected by someone, but sorted the most relevant, in my opinion, symbols that can be used on web pages. You just need to click on the symbol or its html-entity, and it will be selected, all that remains is to copy it. I use it for my WYSIWYG editor.
